# MS-DOS development resources
This is my short list of interesting resources for MS-DOS development.

* (F) indicates a favorite of mine
* (S) is one of my own projects

# Compiler
# DJGPP (F)
DJGPP is a complete 32-bit C/C++ development system for Intel 80386 (and higher) PCs running DOS. It includes ports of many GNU development utilities. The development tools require a 80386 or newer computer to run, as do the programs they produce. In most cases, the programs it produces can be sold commercially without license or royalties.
